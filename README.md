# R for Experimental Design and Data Analysis in Chemistry

## Introduction
Welcome to the R repository for experimental design and data analysis in chemistry. This repository provides a collection of R scripts and resources to assist chemists in designing experiments and analyzing experimental data using R.

## Installation
To use the scripts in this repository, you will need to have R installed on your system. Additionally, certain packages are required for specific analyses. You can install these packages using the following command in R:

```R
install.packages("package_name")
```

## Usage
### Experimental Design
The `experimental_design.R` script allows users to design experiments in chemistry using various experimental designs such as factorial designs, response surface methodologies, and more. Detailed instructions for using this script can be found in the script itself.

### Data Analysis
The `data_analysis.R` script provides tools for importing, cleaning, processing, and analyzing experimental data in R. This script covers a range of statistical analyses commonly used in chemistry experiments, including t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis, and more.
